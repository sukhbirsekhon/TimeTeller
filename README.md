# TimeTeller (Project 1)

## The goal of this script is to tell you current date and time.

I always wondered how to write a program that tells you current date and time. So I decided to make this project using python's datetime library. 

All you need to run this program is Python 3. To make sure that you have python 3 installed in your computer, run this command in your terminal/command prompt: 

```bash
python --version
```

If you are using Linux, then you may need to specify Python3
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should receive something similar to this following output:

If you receive an error message, then you should go to this website and follow instructions on how to download python: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download Python3</a>

Once you've setup your python, go ahead and clone this project on your local machine. 

If you already have git installed on your computer, then run this command in your command prompt:

```git
git clone https://github.com/sukhbirsekhon/TimeTeller.git
```

It will download the project for you in your current directory path. 

You can also download the project in .zip format folder on your local machine from github itself.

Once you've cloned or downloaded the project, run the program using python from cloned project directory

```python
python dateTime.py
```

Here is an example output:

```
Today's date is 30 Sep, 2021
and Current time is 01:32:03 PM
```

(Note: The date and time will be different for you for obvious reasons)

Voila! You made it!
